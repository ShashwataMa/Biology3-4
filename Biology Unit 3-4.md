                            - Function:: Regulates fluidity of the membrane. At higher temperatures, the cholesterol keeps phospholipids bound together, preventing unwanted substances from slipping through holes. At lower temperatures, the cholesterol disrupts the fatty acid tails, stopping phospholipids from becoming a solid boundary.

                    - Why is it important that phospholipids are amphipathic?:: Because it allows the plasma membrane to be stable as the fatty acid tails are repelled from water whereas the phosphate heads are attracted to water, so a stable bilayer naturally forms.
                    - **Orientation**
                        - Because they are {{hydrophobic}}, the fatty acid tails orient themselves {{away}} from the intra and extracellular fluid to form the middle portion of the PB.
                        - Because they are {{hydrophilic}}, the phosphate heads orient themselves {{towards}} the aqueous intra and extracellular fluid to form the outer and inner portion of the PB.

                - **Summary**
                    - The plasma membrane is fluid-mosaic, meaning it is made of many components like phosphlipids, proteins, cholestrol and carbohydrates. The fluid part comes from the fact that the cholestrol that is embedded between the fatty acid tails of the PB, regulates fluidity. It is important for the plasma membrane to be fluid because it allows it to fuse with other membranes and maintains a stable osmotic gradient between the internal and external environment.

                - Secondary Structure:: The coiling and pleating of the polypeptide into alpha helices or beta pleated sheets due to the formation of hydrogen bonds within the polypeptide chain.
                    - Alpha helix:: Loops of the helix are formed when the hydrogen and oxygen of distant amino acids bond in a coil. Relatively elastic.
                    - Beta-pleated sheet:: Parts of a peptide fold back to align with neighboring parts of the polypeptide chain. Not elastic
                    - Random coiling:: Areas of a polypeptide that don't align into organized structures, often found between organized structures. Assists in the unique shape of a protein.

                - 
                - 1. Initiation
                    - Specific proteins called  _**transcription factors **_  _bind to the promoter region_  **upstream of the gene of interest.**
                    - This  _allows the RNA Polymerase to bind to the promoter region_  (TATA Box in eukaryotes). The ^^**DNA **^^^^ _**unwinds and unzips, exposing the nucleotides on the template strand**_ ^^**.**
                - 2. Elongation
                    - RNA Polymerase  _catalyzes the synthesis of of a pre-mRNA strand_  ^^**along the template strand**^^.
                    - The RNA Polymerase  _reads the template strand in 3' to 5' direction_  and  _synthesizes the pre-mRNA strand in 5' to 3'_  direction from  _free floating RNA nucleotides in the nucleus that are complementary to the template strand_ .
                - **3. **^^**Termination**^^
                    -  Once the RNA Polymerase reaches the  _specific terminator region_ , the RNA folds back on itself, forming a  _hairpin loop_ , this  _detaches the pre-mRNA_  strand from the template strand. pre-mRNA is formed.
                    - 
                        - DNA unwinds to expose template strand
                        - RNA Polymerase attach to specific sequence in promotes region of the gene.
                        - pre-mRna is formed
                - RNA Polymerase binds to the promoter region of DNA, specifically of the template strand. A section of DNA is 'unzipped' by the RNA Polymerase, and the enzyme begins to add complementary bases to the template strand. Note: In eukaryotes, the promoter region is often the sequence of bases ‘TATAAA’, commonly known as the **TATA box**. The pre-mRNA strand keeps growing until the RNA Polymerase reads the terminator region, the sequence of DNA that signals the end for transcription.
            - **2. RNA Processing**** (PTM) **
                - From pre-mRNA to an mRNA molecule.

                - 
                - 1:: Addition of 5' methyl cap and poly-A tail
                    - Function (Why?):: The addition of the 5' methyl cap prevents the RNA molecule from degrading, contributes to it's stability and assists the mRNA movement to the ribosome. The addition of the Poly-A Tail at the 3' end of the mRNA strand contribute to it's stability, this is done through slowing down the breakdown of mRNA in the cytoplasm.
                - Introns:: Non-coding sections of RNA.
                - Exons:: Coding regions of RNA.
                - 
                - 
                - Process (How?):: Introns are spliced out during RNA Processing, and exons are joined together.'
                    - 
                    - Alternative splicing:: The process where  _**different**_  proteins can be produced from the  _**same**_  pre-mRNA strand, depending on whether or not  _**all the introns (non coding) were cut out**_  and discarded (intron retention) or if  _**all the exons (coding) are used**_  in the final mRNA (exon juggling. This means that different combinations of introns are removed and exons spliced together, producing structurally  different mRNA strands, hence leading to functionally different proteins.
                        - A gene could produce a particular protein in a cell of a certain tissue, but produce a different protein in a cell of another tissue, this contributes to the functional diversity of proteins in the proteome.

                - 
                - 1. Initiation
                    - Ribosome joins with mRNA strand to form the ribosome complex.
                    - This initiator tRNA carries the first amino acid in the polypeptide to the ribosome, attatches it's anticodon to the complementary start codon and offloads the first amino acid in the polypeptide at the ribosome.
                - 2. Elongation
                    - A tRNA that has the complementary anticodon to the next mRNA codon carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome.
                    - The tRNA anticodon binds to the complementary mRNA codon and offloads a specific amino acid at the ribosome.
                    - The amino acids join together through peptide bonds via condensation polymerization between the amine nitrogen of an amino acid and the carbon carboxyl group of the adjacent amino acid, forming water as a byproduct. This process creates a polypeptide chain.
                - 3. Termination
                    - Termination of translation occurs once a stop codon in the mRNA enters the A site of the ribosome.
                    - Specific proteins called release factors cause the detachment of the mRNA strand from the ribosome and the polypeptide is released.
            - **Key Terms**
                - Non-overlapping:: A quality of genetic code that means nucleic acids are read in consecutive sets of three nucleotides, and that each nucleotide is only part of one codon/triplet.
                - Degenerate:: A quality of genetic code which means that more than one codon can code for the same amino acid.
                - Universal:: A quality of genetic code which means that the same codons code for the same amino acids in all living things. All living things use the same nucleotide structure and and same bases (A,C,T/U,G)
    -  _Enzymes_ 
        - **5A Enzymes**
            - Enzyme:: Enzymes are organic catalysts that lower the activation energy of reactions.
                - Activation energy:: Energy required to initiate a reaction
                - Active site:: The region on an enzyme where a substrate binds onto. 
                    - Why can enzymes only bind with specific substrates? Explain:: ^^The active site on an enzyme makes enzyme specific.^^ The set of variable R groups of the amino acids found in the active site, along with their positions in 3D space give the ^^**active site a specific size, shape and chemical behavior**^^^^.^^ Therefore, only substrates with the specific properties and complementary shape to the active site can bind to the active on an enzym.
                - Allosteric site:: Site on an enzyme that is not the active site that molecules can bind to and facilitate or inhibit the binding of a substrate, done through the reversible conformational shape change of the enzyme, influencing the enzyme's ability to be active.
            - Characteristics of enzymes:: They are not used up in reactions, can sometimes work in both directions of a reaction and on entire pathways, and their active sites are specific to particular substrates.
            - How does temperature and pH relate to enzyme activity?:: The activity of an enzyme is greatest at its optimal temperature, above this it begins to quickly denature. The activity of an enzyme is greatest and it's optimal pH value. Relatively high and low pH values can also denature enzymes.
            - Effect of increasing enzyme concentration:: Increasing enzyme concentration increases the frequency of collision between enzymes and substrates, increases the overall rate at which reactants are converted into products. Increasing enzyme concentration will increase overall enzyme activity until there is not enough substrate.
            - Effect of increasing substrate concentration:: Increasing substrate concentration increases frequency of collisions between enzymes and substrates, increasing the overall rate at which substrates bind and occupy active sites, increasing overall enzyme activity. Increasing substrate concentration will increase overall enzyme activity until the active sites of all the enzymes become occupied, causing them to become saturated and cannot catalyze reactions at a faster rate.
            - 
            - How does substrate concentration affect the speed of enzymatic reactions?
                - Increasing substrate concentration increases the frequency of enzyme-substrate collisions, this increases the rate at which substrates bind and occupy active sites of  enzymes, increasing speed of enzymatic reactions. Increasing substrate concentration increases the speed of enzyme activity until a point where the active sites of all the enzymes are occupied. causing them to become saturated and plateau in rate/speed of enzymatic reactions.
                - 
                - Increasing enzyme concentration increases the frequency of enzyme-substrate collisions, this increases the rate at which reactants are converted to products.

        - 5B Inhibiting Enzymes
            - Inhibitor:: Molecule that binds to an enzyme and prevents or greatly reduces it's function of catalyzing enzyme-substrate reactions 
            - Reversible inhibitor:: Inhibitor which can bind and disassociate from the active site or allosteric site of an enzyme, hence does not inhibit the enzymes function permanently.
            - Irreversible inhibitor:: Inhibitor which permanently binds onto the active site or allosteric site of an enzyme, permanently inhibiting the formation of enzyme substrate complex and preventing the enzyme from functioning properly or at all.
            - Competitive inhibitor![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ1UUqxSv8Lpdx9fH-fuECvsq01Srowzs0q3BhgKXqVXe-JGeU&s)
                - Molecules that prevents the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex **by competing with the substrate at the active site**.
                - This is done by the molecule** **^^**binding to the active site of an enzyme**^^,** blocking and preventing** specific substrates from binding to the active site of that enzyme.
                - This is possible as the competitive inhibitor has a complementary shape to the active site, but does not trigger a enzyme-substrate reaction since it's structure isn't exactly the same as the substrate.
                - **Increase in substrate will reduce the inhibitor's effectiveness**
            - Non-competitive inhibitor![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTgcwi_TZO90RQZ5D2sICsM_g-Hho63X_WeN_2FPN6YaaRA6PBj&s)
                - Molecules that prevents the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex by binding to the **allosteric site of an enzyme.**
                - This causes a ^^**conformational shape change**^^ of an enzyme, hence of also ^^**it's active site**^^, **blocking and preventing **specific substrates from binding to the active site and preventing enzyme substrate reactions.
                - Reduces the rate of reaction, **regardless of how much substrate is added.**

                - Steps/Points
                    - Light energy is absorbed by light-trapping pigments (mainly chlorophyll)
                    - The absorbed energy is used to split water (H2O) into e-, 2H+ ions and 1/2 Oxygen (O2)
                    - Energy is transferred to photosystems as electrons move across the thylakoid membrane pumping H+ ions along the thylakoid membrane
                    - NADP+ uncharged carrier molecule accepts an electron to become a NADPH charged carrier molecule
                    - Energy that travels across the electron transport chain pump H+ ions into the thylakoid lumen from the stroma which facilitates the ADP + Pi into ATP at the ATPase enzyme as it diffuses down it electrochemical concentration gradient back into the stroma (chemiosmosis).

        - 6C Factors Affecting Photosynthesis
            - **Factors affecting photosynthesis**
                - Light intensity
                    - Increase in light intensity increases the rate of **light dependent reactions,** therefore** photosynthesis increases proportionally.  **
                    - This occurs as light intensity increases, more photons of light hit the leaf cells, causing a greater number of chlorophyll molecules to be ionized.
                    - Above a certain light intensity, the rate of photosynthesis will eventually plateau due to **some other limiting factor like temperature, CO2 concentration.**
                - Light Wavelength
                    - Photosynthesis is **most efficient** when the wavelengths of light that hits the leaf are of **red and blue** wavelengths as **chlorophyll pigments** strongly absorbs red and blue light wavelengths
                    - Photosynthesis is **least efficient** when the wavelength of light that hits the leaf is **green** as chlorophyll pigments itself are green, so it reflects green light and doesn't absorb and convert it into chemical energy.
                - CO2 concentration
                    - Increase in CO2 concentration increase the rate of **light independent reactions, **therefore **photosynthesis increases proportionally. **
                    - This occurs as CO2 concentration increases, there are more collisions between CO2 substrates and enzymes involved in the Calvin cycle**, **so there is an increase at the rate of carbon fixation into a carbohydrate.
                    - Above a certain CO2 concentration, the rate of photosynthesis will eventually plateau **due to saturation of enzymes involved in the Calvin cycle OR some other limiting factor like water, light, or temperature.**
                - **Temperature**
                    - Increase in temperature increases the **kinetic energy** of substrates and enzymes involved in photosynthesis, causing greater frequency of enzyme-substrate **collisions** and faster **rate of photosynthesis**.
                    - However, **ABOVE **a certain **optimal temperature**, enzymes begin to **denature and undergo an irreversible conformational shape change at it's tertiary structure** so are unable to function, this causes the rate of photosynthesis significantly decreases past the optimal temperature.
            - ATP Cycle
                - ATP is broken down into ADP + Pi when cells require energy for metabolic processes
                - ATP is continuously regeneratable as ADP + Pi can undergo phosphorolysis and form ATP when there is an energy supply (mainly from cellular respiration)

                    - This means the cell would **evade apoptotic stimuli**, leading to cell ^^**immortality**^^.
                    - The ^^^^^^**accumulation**^^^^ ^^of many of these cells with the apoptotic-inhibiting mutations would lead to tumor growth and cancer.
                - **Degenerative disease**
                    - The deregulation of BAX and BCL-2 proteins would mean there is an **upregulation i**n BAX **pro**-apoptotic proteins and an **downregulation **in BCL-2 **anti**-apoptotic proteins, this would increase ^^^^^^**mitochondrial membrane permeability**^^**.**
                    - This means the cell would **release Cytochrome C** and lead to apoptosis even when there is **not a apoptotic stimuli**.
                    - This would lead to death of healthy tissue cells ^^(could be said in stem of question)^^ that are not supposed to undergo apoptosis, leading to a degenerative disorder (e.g Alzheimer's, Parkinson's).

        -  _Nervous System_ 
            - Explain neuron structure
                - Dendrites: Location on neuron where nerve impulse is received and sent towards cell body.
                - Axon: Part of neuron where action potential is sent away from cell body and towards the axon terminal.
                - Myelin sheath: Companion cells which trap their thick membranes around axon to form a thick insulating lipid layer, speeds up neural transmission
                - Synapse: Location between neurons where the nerve impulse can be passed from the axon terminal of one neuron (pre-synaptic neuron) to the dendron of another (post-synaptic neuron) .
            - **Neuron Types **
                - What do sensory neurons do?
                    - Sensory neurons are involved in the sensory (afferent) division of the PNS that transmits sensory information about the external or internal environments to the CNS where the information is processed.
                    - Messages from receptors are sent away from the central organ and towards the brain or spinal cord.
                - Why are motor neurons essential for survival?
                    - Motor neurons are involved in the motor (**efferent**) division of the PNS and transmit information **away from the CNS**, **relay** messages from the **brain or spinal cord** to the **muscles** or organs. So if you pick up a hot cup, the receptors on the skin send signals to CNS (neuron to neuron) then eventually the CNS sends signal down to the motor neuron which connect to muscles (neuron to muscle) to relax the hand.
            - Interneuron function
                - **Relays** message from sensory (afferent) neurons to motor (efferent) neurons
                - Found in the brain and spinal cord, part of the CNS.
                - Only half of interneurons are myelinated. This is because interneurons are **short **so the **action potential loss is limited and there's not too much need for myelination**
            - Neurohormones
                - Chemical messengers released by neurons into the bloodstream that travel to the target organ where the signal is transduced and the receptor cell responds.****
            - ^^ _Signal transduction between neurons_ ^^
                - **Action potential **reaches the axon terminal and **depolarizes** the membrane. Change in **polarity **opens **Voltage-gated ion channels**, causing Ca2+ **facilitated diffusion into pre-synaptic terminal.**
                - Neurotransmitter **diffuse **across the synaptic cleft and bind to **Ligand-gated Na+ ion channels** on the **post-synaptic dendrite.**
                - **Na+ ions **flood inside axon on **post-synaptic neuron**, initiating **action potential**.
                - To **prevent the continued activation of post-synaptic neuron**, neurotransmitters are:  _a._  **broken down by enzymes**,  b. **diffuse away **from the synapse, c. **taken up **by pre-synaptic neuron.

        -  _Plant hormones_ 
            - Auxin
                - Phototropism: Hormones that are repelled by a light stimulus and so diffuse from the apex to the shaded parts of the shoot. This higher concentration of auxin in the shaded part of the shoot causes the cells in that area to elongate so that the stem bends towards the light.
                - Geotropism: Stimulus of gravity causes auxin to accumulate in lower parts of the plant, stimulates cell elongation in stem cell but inhibit it in root cells.
                - IAA: Type of auxin that inhibits the growth of lateral buds **close to the apex**.

                    - ectionally which contain infection fighting WBC's, lymph drains through lymph nodes where APC's present antigen to initiate cell mediated or humoral response via B or T cells.
                    - Lymph:: **Fluid **that flows unidirectionally through the lymphatic system, towards lymph nodes and eventually lymph vessels where it drains back into the circulatory system, contains infection fighting WBC's
                    - Lymph is ^^**NOT**^^^^ ^^ pumped through the lymphatic system, but relies on ^^**muscle contractions**^^ and valves
                    - Composed of primary and secondary organs like bone marrow and thymus
                    - Lymph Nodes
                        - Encases **B and T cells, memory and naïve cells**. Lymph fluid drains through lymph nodes ^^**unidirectionally**^^
                        - Antigen-presenting cells move into lymph nodes via lymph vessels that drain from blood
                        - Lymphocytes can come across and bind to their specific epitiope of the antigen from the APC,
                        - leading to naïve B or T cells to undergo clonal selection and leading to a specific adaptive immune response
                    - Primary Lymphatic System:: Responsible for the ^^**development and production**^^** of immune cells** 
                        - Bone marrow
                            - To produce stem cells that differentiate to all **leukocytes and lymphocytes**
                            - All **blood cells** **develop **from here
                            - **B **Cells undergo **self tolerance** and **mature **here
                        - What happens if bone marrow is damaged?:: Damagehere would mean reduced immune response and impaired ability to remove pathogens from their body.
                        - Thymus:: T cells undergo development/maturation here
                    - Secondary Lymphatic System:: ^^**Harbor**^^** matured immune cells **and** **provide the** **^^**environment**^^** **for the** initiation of the **^^**immune response**^^ 
                        - Spleen:: ^^**FILTERS BLOOD**^^**, ** detects **foreign invaders **and produces **antibodies**
                        - Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT):: ^^**Survey **^^for **pathogens **and protect from invaders
                    - Lymphatic System vs Circulatory System
                        - Lymphatic system requires muscle contraction for movement whereas the circulatory requires heart
                        - Both have valves
                - B Lymphocytes
                    - Made and matured in Bone Marrow
                    - Responsible for the destruction of pathogens by producing proteins - antibodies
                - T Lymphocytes
                    - Made in Bone Marrow, mature in Thymus
                    - Destroying virally infected and cancerous cells - Cytotoxic T cell (TC)
                    - Helper T (TH) and Regulatory (TREG) assist the other lymphocytes in performing their roles
                - Antibodies
                    - ^^**Coating **^^of cellular binding sites of pathogens – inhibiting connection to the host (^^**neutralization**^^)
                    - Antibody binds to antigen, marking the microbe  _more susceptible to phagocytosis_  (^^**opsonization**^^)
                    - Antibodies ^^**cluster and bind**^^ pathogens together (^^**agglutination**^^) - Easier to destroy pathogen
                    - ^^**Activate **^^complement proteins to aid in pathogen destruction
                - Humoral Response
                    - APC like dendritic cell will engulf the pathogen, then present the non-self antigen on its MHC 2 marker and migrate to the lymph node via lymph.
                    - -Free pathogen-specific antigens will also migrate to the lymph node and bind to the specific naive B cell with the complementary receptor, clonally selecting it.
                    - -Another APC will bind the pathogen-specific antigen on its MHC 2 marker to the CD4 receptor on the T helper cell, stimulating the release of interleukins, which bind to the clonally selected B cell and fully activate it, causing clonal expansion
                    - -The B cell proliferates and differentiates into B memory cells and B plasma cells, which produce the antigen-specific antibodies that neutralise, opsonise, agglutinate and activate complement proteins to destroy the pathogen.
                    - -The memory B cells will reside in the lymph nodes of the body for the rest of the person's life and produce many more antibodies on subsequent exposures, leading to a larger and faster response to the pathogen, the person remains immune to the pathogen.
                - 
            - **Vaccine and Malfunctions**
                - Vaccines:: Contain dead or attenuated microbes, are used to activate an adaptive immune response to produce antibodies against specific pathogens without actually causing the disease
                - Why are vaccines effective?:: Vaccine will allow the body to create the pathogen-specific antibodies in the case a functional pathogen enters, all without actually harming the person.    
                - Discuss why a vaccine that has the same antigens in it as a pathogen cause an adaptive immune response?
                    - The antigens in the vaccine would activate the innate immune system and **antigen presenting cells** (macrophages and dendritic cells) would **phagocytose** the antigens.
                    - The APC would migrate to a lymph node and present the antigen on it's **MHC 2** marker to activate T helper cells, which then activate naïve B cell that has encountered and presented same antigen
                    - Through clonal selection, the specific B and T cells that contain a receptor that is specific and complimentary to the antigen would proliferate and differentiate (Clonal expansion) into B plasma cells/cytotoxic T cells, and B and T ^^**memory cells**^^ which reside in the lymph nodes to allow for ^^**larger and faster**^^ immune responses on subsequent exposures.
                    - 
                - **Types of immunity **
                    - Natural, Passive:: When an individual receives antibodies through natural means, memory cells are not produced, e.g. through breast milk or through blood-placenta barriers. 
                    - Artificial, Passive:: When an individual receives antibodies through medical intervention, memory cells are not produced
                        - e.g. Injected with immunoglobins
                - Monoclonal Antibody:: Artificial protein that mimics the function of a human antibody, used to target specific antigens like on cancer cells.
                - How are monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancer?
                    - Organism like mice is injected with cancer-specific antigen, stimulates clonal selection and expansion of B cells
                    - B plasma cells are harvested and artificially fused with myeloma to create immortal cells. Hybrid cells called hybridoma divide and produce antigen-specific antibodies
                    - Hybridoma produces identical monoclonal antibodies specific to antigen on cancer cells
                - Explain how the immune response in a vaccinated mouse would kill invading H. pylori cells?:: The vaccinated mouse would have many memory B cells specific to the bacteria from the first exposure. When the bacteria infect the mouse, APC phagocytes would engulf the bacteria and display the antigens on their surface. T Helper cells would bind their CD4 receptor to the epitope of these antigens on the APC, activating many memory B cells to divide and produce plasma cells with antibodies against the bacterial antigens. These antibodies would destroy the H. pylori bacteria before stomach ulcers could form. 
                - Describe stages of an allergic reactions
                    - Allergen enters body, normal humoral response occurs
                    - B plasma cells produce ^^**IgE antibodies which bind to mast cells via their heavy chain, individual is sensitized**^^
                    - On second exposure, allergen binds onto specific IgE antibodies on mast cells
                    - Stimulates degranulation, releases pro-inflammatory molecules like histamines and cytokines, Smooth-muscle contraction (airways blocked), vasodilation and increased permeability of blood vessels (inflammation)
                - Anti-venom
                    - Is anti-venom passive or active:: Passive as there is no memory cell formation as there are only antibody proteins in the vaccine.
                    - Does anti-venom provide immunity:: No, as no non-self antigens were involved, no adaptive immune response occurred, no memory cells produced and so person would not be immune. 
                - Explain autoimmune diseases using multiple sclerosis
                    - Leakage occurs in the blood-brain barrier, allows for entry of immune cells which recognize the nerve tissue as foreign
                    - **Inflammation causes the **removal of the myelin from neurons and degradation
                    - **Myelin antigens are released into the lymphatic system, **immune cells are attracted to site (**chemotaxis)**
                    - **Activated TH cells **permeate the blood-brain barrier, release **cytokines **which activate other immune cells, producing more **myelin antigen**
                    - **B cells **produce **antibodies **than bind to myelin, increasing phagocyte action
                    - Process cannot be stopped as the cycle of damaged nerves releasing chemokines is a positive feedback loop which is unstoppable
                    - However, multiple sclerosis can be slowed by the use of anti-inflammatory drugs

        - Experimental Group: 50 chilli plants with apical bud removed
        - Control Group: 50 chilli plants with apical bud not removed
        - Repeat: 3 times
        - Experiment:
        - 1. Set up 100 chilli plants in the same pot (with fixed water amount in litres) in a room with a light source of controlled light intensity.
        - 2. Remove the apical bud of only 50 of the plants.
        - 3. Measure the bending of plant stem as compared to the light source, repeat 3 times.
        - Results to support hypothesis: The 50 plants that had their apical bud removed would not bend their stem towards the light source, the other 50 that didn't have their apical bud removed would bend their stem toward the light source.

        - The function of genes:: to carry inherited genetic information from one generation to the next.
        - 
        - Process and application of alternative splicing:: When a gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase, a pre-mRNA strand is produced. This pre-mRNA strand can produce different mRNA molecules depending on whether or not all introns are cut out or discarded (intron retention), and whether or not all exons are used in the final mRNA strand (exon shuffling). This process of alternative splicing leads to the production of structurally, hence functionally diverse proteins.

            - ^^After translation, the molecule formed will be in its secondary structure as it has undergone specific folding at the endoplasmic reticulum, however, this molecule still needs to fold into it's tertiary/quaternary structure in order to become a functional protein and it also needs to packaged into a secretory vesicle to then be exported to its appropriate location outside the cell.^^
            - ^^So the molecule travels to the Golgi Complex to be modified into a functional protein, sorted and packaged^^ ^^into a secretory vesicle and exported by its vesicle fusing with the cell membrane and releasing the protein into the extracellular environment, via exocytosis.^^

    - SAC 4 Immunity
        - Adaptive Response
            - If a response is specific then it is:: Adaptive
            - Bone Marrow function and effect of damage:: To produce stem cells that differentiate to all leukocytes and lymphocytes, damage here would mean reduced immune response and impaired ability to remove pathogens from their body.     
            - The main difference between cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells is that natural killer cells:: Natural killer cells do not form memory cells, whereas cytotoxic T cell do form memory cells
            - What occurs when an individual becomes sensitized to an allergen?:: IgE antibodies produced during humoral response to the allergen, bind to mast cells via the heavy chain. sensitizing the individual.
                - This is a what question, so you need to explain the process. It also says when, meaning during the event of someone being sensitized, not directly after. So with these question, if it doesn't say after, you assume its happening presently and you need to explain it.
            - bind to mast cells via the heavy chain. sensitising the individual
        - Vaccines and Malfunctions
            - When a micro-organism is exposed to a person, what kind of immunity is it?:: Natural, acquired and specific
            - A human is bit by a radioactive spider, the best remedy for this is?, Explain your answer
                - You can't use spider antibodies since they will recognize the venom as 'self'
                - You can't antibodies from other animals unless they are specific to the spider venom
                - The best choice is to use venom antitoxin raised in another animal so that when injected into the human, it neutralizes the toxin
            - Why is aids so difficult to treat?:: AIDS causes T helper cell levels of 200 cells/mm3, this is a critically low level of important immune cells, this means the immune system is compromised and trying to kill the virus may cause more damage that could be fatal
            - Why are multiple doses sometimes required?:: Some vaccines don't give an individual lifelong immunity and their effect declines after the initial dose, that why sometimes multiple doses or 'booster' doses are required to re-expose the individual to the pathogen-specific antigen and cause increased immunity to the pathogen which will suffice the protection needed.
            - Discuss why a vaccine that has the same antigens in it as a plasmodium cause an adaptive immune response?
                - Although this was a why question, because it was 3 marks and ask why something causes a response, you can treat it like a how question as they are similar
